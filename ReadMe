Usage:

	1. Compile
		make clean; make

	2. To train the robot
		./Zhang-Project3 train
		
		Note: Training takes less than 10 minutes of "Stage time" to finish with the default start point. It may take longer time to learning with other start points. Drag it a little bit if the robot stucks.
	
	3. To test the policy
		./Zhang-Project3 test
		
		Note: Testing takes around 12 minutes of "Stage time"  to cover the whole map. Sometimes the robot may get stuck in the complex area around [-8, 8]. Drag the robot manually and it will work fine again.
